# RedLan-Language
a language for automating work with information systems

# RedRackView Cable Magazine Project
 # Introduction
Accounting in IT plays a very important role. Of course, the knowledge of how to configure Catalyst from scratch, assemble degraded RAID and configure a new Oracle database instance is very valuable and the person who owns them deserves respect. However, when there are several server racks of these Catalyst's and other IBM Flex's, and not in the same room, then the question: "Where is the very server on which the RAID fell down" can stump more than one specialist. The search for a specific server, I'm not talking about network cables, can turn into an exciting quest. And don't let ping run into such a quest in the conditions of an accident. This is the case when we started developing this program.
# RedLang scripting language

Built-in scripting language for automating the work of system administrators. Everyone will be able to write an automated algorithm to fill in the log. For example, to add modules and servers to the blade chassis. It will be difficult to do this in other programs, but here it is easy to do it both in the program itself and for your own purposes, efforts can be nullified using a script. For example, the script will prompt you to enter the name of the server module, etc. and will do everything for you.
It is also worth noting that you can use the language not only for automating the processes of the program itself, but also for personal purposes. Also, everyone will be able to expand the functionality of this language with the help of modules written in Python. RedLang can easily work with them.
The language is currently under development, actively developing and preparing for release. It will be possible to use it together with the program in about 3-4 months. And for personal purposes in the near future.
